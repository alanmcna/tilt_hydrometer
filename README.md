# What / why?

Just like DIY? Yeah, me too. I'm all for supporting the existing market place offerings but I was keen to try this for myself (it didn't look too hard, spoiler - it wasn't) and there's no obvious local solution.

Also I see many other solutions avoided WIFI 2.4ghz issues by using bluetooth - let's say I much prefer wifi and was keen to see if it was possible

# Can the PICO deepsleep 

Best article on this I have found here https://ghubcoder.github.io/posts/deep-sleeping-the-pico-micropython/

The base for this test is therefore https://github.com/ghubcoder/micropython-pico-deepsleep.git

## Hardware 

* Centrifuge Tube, 50mL with capï¼Œround bottom - NOTE: 50ml is really too small, check the other tubes they're much bigger maybe 75-120ml - this provides more room for the electronics and tweaking base tilt angles.
** Pre-forms would be ideal but found them hard to source in NZ without buying blind and hoping, not expensive but kinda key.
* Pico W (no headers)
* GY-9250 (MPU-9250) - 9-Axis Altitude + Gyro + Accelerator + Magnetometer Sensor Module
** imo.py and vector3d.py - see https://github.com/micropython-IMU should probably use mpu9250.py in place of the generic imu
* Panasonic NCR18650BD 18650 Lithium Ion Battery https://www.simpower.co.nz/product/individual-cells-batteries/lithium-batteries/18650-batteries/panasonic-ncr18650bd-18650-lithium-ion-battery/
* 3d printed housing (with pegs) - see models folder for latest iteration
* Misc - Wires, Solder, etc

## Software

* Pico running compiled 'deepsleep' firmware with main python scripts and libraries
** See config for wifi connection and post end-point
** default sleep is 2 minutes - the HTTP post response can change this to be 12-24 hours 
* Server to 'collect' the JSON post from the tilt hydrometer and log the data 
** Flask
*** The JSON post response provides the sleep time
** Python
** R scipts for graphing

## Testing / Calibration

* Existing tilt hydrometer with varying sugar solutions
** 1.000 Water
** 1.010
** 1.020
** 1.040
* Plot them a choose a line of best fit (polynomial o3, or a straight line)
* Ideally have 15-20deg in water raising to close to 40+ in strong solution
** The denser the flatter
